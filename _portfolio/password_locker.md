description: Password locker is a command line application that stores your password in encrypted form. You can save passwords in this application and retrieve password for a perticular user ID. Password will be copied to the clipboard and clipboard will be cleared in 5 seconds. For each task you require a key. What if you forget the key? Then forget all your passwords.. I created this app for personal use and use it frequently. Headover to <a href="https://github.com/Pranav1999/battery_notifier">https://github.com/Pranav1999/battery_notifier</a> for more details.
