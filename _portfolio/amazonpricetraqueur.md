description: AmazonPriceTraqueur is a python application that tracks prices of products for you and sends you email whenever price of your favorite product drops below a threshold. The application used webscraping and and a configuration file where you can specify products to track, base_url of the amazon website for your region, mailing server address and your email account credentials. I created this app as I wanted to track my favorite headphones that were not in my budget but were known to be on sale frequently.
