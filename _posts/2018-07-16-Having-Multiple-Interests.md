Hope this post helps you if you are stuck in the same situation and you won't feel overwhelmed..


I don't know what we call someone who has multiple passions at the same time, but whatever it is.. that person is me. I am always intereted in multiple things, wanting to do all the things at the same time. I am always confused what should I pursue, or atleast I was. I have gone from Android app development, to Web Development, to Social Networks, to Data Mining, to Machine learning, to sub-domains of Machine learning, all this in just a year. I have multiple passions but I feel I can't run after all of them, like I don't have time. Many times I am just overwhelmed by my own passions. What to pursue and what not. I follow one thing for some time, then I find my heart slipping for another one and I race towards it. By the time I am at the finish line, some other thing pull my heart. I want to do everything at once. My to do list goes from noob topics to advanced topics and it is not limited to tech only.

## Is it good?
Yes it is. This trait of my personality is what made me learn so much of different domains. It makes me think and try things.

## Is it bad?
Yes, it is. I feel like I cannot give time to everything and end up doing just one thing. After a while it gets boring and I end up with something else.

## What went wrong?
What I used to do was, I used to commit all my time on just one thing. If I wanted to learn Android App Development, I would just do that. Nothing else. Soon when I used to find another great topic to learn, I shifted towards it. This method was so so wrong.

## What I realised?
I realised after a long time what I was doing wrong. Giving all your time to just a single thing is really really wrong if you don't have an end goal. I used to learn something without a project in my mind. Soon enough I got bored and shifted toward other things. Now what I do is I distribute my time. And whatever I do I keep an end goal in my mind. If I am learning python I make projects alongside. Not large scale projects but ones that help me in my daily work. Like I created a script that would remind me about charging my laptop, or a safe password locker.

Having multiple interests used to be a disadvantage but now I am turning it into an advantage.
